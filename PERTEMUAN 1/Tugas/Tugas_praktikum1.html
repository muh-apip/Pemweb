        trawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-
        studded. They come from a low-growing plant belonging to genus Fragaria
        of the rose (Rosaceae) family, enclosing white flowers, lobed foliage,
        and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.
        <br /><br />
        They are the most famous and trendlist fruits in the planet (Roger).
        There are over 600 assortments of strawberries that vary in taste, size,
        and feel; all of which have similar trait; heart silhouette, red fleshy
        tissue with yellow seeds shooting the surface, petite, royal, leafy green
        lids, and stalk that embellish their crowns (WHFoods). Below is Picture

      <p>
        The word strawberry is coined from 'strewn" berries about the plants and
        thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "Strawberry" (Roger). They
        are not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the
        plant. The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal
        berry. There are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in
        calories and are non-fat, loaded with vitamin c, folic acid, fiber,
        vitamin B6 and potassium (Roger). <br /><br />
        Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like,
        stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries
        were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth,
        and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is
        at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very
        well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).
